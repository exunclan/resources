## How to start making games:

### <font color="rgb(67,67,67)">GamePlay:</font>

Basically, what are the core mechanics of your game going to be? Is it shooting people randomly? a ball that bounces around the terrain? Racing around in an open world?

### <font color="rgb(67,67,67)">Idea size:</font>

A lot of ideas get stuck during production due to their size. If you are going to think of a open world multiplatform RPG with AAA graphics, that idea is going to stay as just that. An idea. You are not Valve or CD Projekt RED. Indie games are loved for their simple yet simple ideas and gameplay.

### <font color="rgb(67,67,67)">Decide the Engine:</font>

So now you have come up with an million dollar idea, let's turn it to a reality.

Game engines are reusable components used to build the framework of the game.This gives them more time to focus on the unique elements like character models, textures, how objects interact instead of reinventing the wheel and programming the renderer or physics.

Choosing the right game engine suited to your game is important. Else you may end up spending months to make a game which can be realised in weeks in another engine like:Unity is best for Platformers. Unreal engine lets an indie developer create AAA graphics with no coding whereas cryengine beats all engines if you need a shooter.

### <font color="rgb(67,67,67)">Monetizing:</font>

You are not EA, and people would not pay you to unlock in game characters.
Start with free games and when you have built a market presence start including in app purchases and monetizing games. One great way to include monetization in your games is to include in game adds but ensure that they are not intrusive and don't take away the attention from the gameplay. Product placements is a great way to do this.

### Some things to keep in mind

During the course of learning Construct and working on your projects, a few tips to produce best results which can be kept in mind are-

- **Design** - A common trend amongst programmers is focusing on the code and undermining the importance of design. Undermining of a key feature like design is what prevents many games from breaking through to a whole different level. Have you ever realized how many popular 2D games, although simple in function, are so amusing? The secret to that is the simple, yet eye-catching design.

* **Precision** - During the development of any project, simple or complicated, precision and awareness are the secret ingredients to success. If one slacks off during the building of the game, a bug which appears during testing may prove to be abstruse, simply as the person will have no idea as to what could have caused it. Moreover, presenting of a low-quality project which lacks uniformity among objects and proper positioning is highly embarrassing. These seemingly minute details can make or break your project.

* **Optimal Code** - Optimal code is possibly the most important portion as it simplifies our process of creating and editing a project to the nth degree. The more optimal the code, the easier it is for us to keep track of the bugs to fix. Moreover writing optimal code also makes it more convenient to add and edit the features of our game.

* **Modularity** - Writing modular code allows you to reuse exisitng classes and functions in many creative ways and helps to create variations of existing objects easily. For example all the enemy types in your game can derive from a single enemy class. 

* **Suggestions are not criticism** - The feedback provided by the people interacting with your project should be taken in a positive manner as they will be the ones playing your game. Using the feedback from the users is a fool-proof way to improve your game.
